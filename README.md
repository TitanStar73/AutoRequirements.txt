# Automatically generate a requirements.txt file for your python project!

1. Download the `main.py` script
2. Copy it to your project directory
3. Run `python main.py`

It will automatically check all files in the directory it is in (and all subdirectories) for `.py` files. It then determines which modules are used and generate the `requirements.txt` file based on the currently installed python libraries on your device.
